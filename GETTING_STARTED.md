## Training the Model using your own Data

To interactively train the model using your own data, we have provided a Jupyter Notebook `Interactive_Parameter_Estimation.ipynb` in the `GMMDetector` folder.
You can follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model using your own data. But, this repo already has a model for graphene, so if you're concerned with graphene you'll be fine with the current model.
