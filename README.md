This repository hosts the code and related resources for the 2DMatGMM project, a robust machine learning system designed to detect and classify 2D material flakes in real-time. The details of the project are published on arXiv in the paper titled "[An open-source robust machine learning platform for real-time detection and classification of 2D material flakes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14845)".

## Features

- **Real-time detection:** The model can detect flakes in real-time on a standard laptop without the need for a GPU.
- **Simple Yet Robust:** The model is based on a simple Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and a Logistic Classifier making it robust to Camera Noise, SiOx variation and Brightness differences.
- **Open-Source:** Any code and dataset used in the project is open-source and available under an MIT license making it possible to modify, extend and use the project for any purpose.
- **Interpretable and Physics-based:** The model uses well understood features reported on by literature and can be easily interpreted and validated.

## Repository Structure

The paper comprises three repositories each containing a part of the project:

- [**2DMatGMM**](https://github.com/Jaluus/2DMatGMM): The code for the machine learning model and the detection algorithm.
- [2DMatGMM-System](https://github.com/Jaluus/2DMatGMM-System): The full detection system used in the laboratory.
- [2DMatGMM-Website](https://github.com/Jaluus/2DMatGMM-Website): The code for the website to analyse, filter and download the flakes.

## Dataset

This Repository contains the dataset used in the paper. The dataset will be made available for download on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8042835). It is currently privately hosted.
The download links as well as metadata about the dataset and usage can be found in the [Dataset Guide](./Datasets/README.md).

## Installation

To install and set up your system to use 2DMatGMM, follow the [installation instructions](INSTALL.md).

## Getting Started

This repository comes with weights pretrained on the datasets used in the paper.
To use the detector for you own projects check out the [Getting Started](GETTING_STARTED.md) guide.

## Quick Start

You may also quickly hop in by trying out the demo on Google Colab. The demo is a Jupyter Notebook which runs the detector on a few demo images from the testset of the Graphene Dataset.
