# WORK IN PROGRESS

## System Specs

Prior motorized stage, probably BX-51 microscope, probably FLIR camera, but we don't actually know for sure yet.

## Installation

To install and set up your system to use the Automated Flake Detector, check out the [installation instructions](INSTALL.md).

## References

The machine learning based detection model in this system uses the detection algorithm from the paper [An open-source robust machine learning platform for real-time detection and classification of 2D material flakes](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ad2287), by authors Jan-Lucas Uslu and Taoufiq Ouaj and David Tebbe and Alexey Nekrasov and Jo Henri Bertram and Marc Sch√ºtte and Kenji Watanabe and Takashi Taniguchi and Bernd Beschoten and Lutz Waldecker and Christoph Stampfer.
